% Given data
weight = 15; % Weight of the box in pounds
specific_weight_aluminum = 0.101; % Specific weight of aluminum in lb/in^3

% Outer dimensions of the box
length = 24; % in
width = 12; % in
height = 4; % in

% Derive volume factor from geometry
bottom_area = length * width; % Area of the bottom
side_area_long = 2 * (length * height); % Combined area of two long sides
side_area_short = 2 * (width * height); % Combined area of two short sides
total_area = bottom_area + side_area_long + side_area_short; % Total area

% Relationship between weight and thickness
% Weight = Specific Weight * Volume
% Volume = Total Area * Thickness
thickness = weight / (specific_weight_aluminum * total_area);

% Display the result
fprintf('The wall thickness x is %.4f inches.\n', thickness);
